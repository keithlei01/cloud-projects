# Stripe Integration Engineering Interview Questions

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of TypeScript coding questions specifically designed for Stripe integration engineering interviews. These questions focus on real-world scenarios that integration engineers encounter daily, rather than traditional algorithm and data structure problems.

## Overview

Integration engineering at Stripe involves building robust, scalable systems that handle payment processing, API integrations, webhook management, and data validation. The questions in this repository are designed to test practical skills relevant to these responsibilities.

### Why TypeScript?

All solutions are implemented in TypeScript because:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- **Modern JavaScript**: Use latest ES features with backward compatibility
- **Industry Standard**: Widely used in modern web development and Node.js
- **Stripe's Stack**: Stripe uses TypeScript extensively in their codebase
- **Better Developer Experience**: Enhanced IDE support, autocomplete, and refactoring
- **Production Ready**: TypeScript compiles to JavaScript for deployment
