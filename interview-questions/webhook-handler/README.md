# Webhook Handler Implementation

## Problem Description

Implement a robust webhook handler system that can receive, validate, and process webhook events from payment providers. This is essential for real-time payment processing and event-driven architectures.

### Requirements

1. **Webhook Reception**: Create an HTTP endpoint to receive webhook payloads.

2. **Signature Verification**: Implement webhook signature verification to ensure authenticity.

3. **Event Processing**: Process different types of webhook events (payment succeeded, failed, refunded, etc.).

4. **Idempotency**: Handle duplicate webhook deliveries using idempotency keys.

5. **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanism for failed event processing.

6. **Event Storage**: Store webhook events for audit and debugging purposes.

### Webhook Event Types

Implement handlers for these common payment webhook events:

- `payment.succeeded` - Payment completed successfully
- `payment.failed` - Payment failed
- `payment.refunded` - Payment was refunded
- `payment.disputed` - Payment is under dispute
- `customer.created` - New customer created
- `customer.updated` - Customer information updated
- `subscription.created` - New subscription created
- `subscription.cancelled` - Subscription cancelled

### Event Payload Structure

```json
{
  "id": "evt_1234567890",
  "type": "payment.succeeded",
  "created": 1640995200,
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "txn_1234567890",
      "amount": 1000,
      "currency": "USD",
      "status": "succeeded",
      "customer_id": "cus_1234567890",
      "description": "Payment for services"
    }
  },
  "livemode": false,
  "pending_webhooks": 1,
  "request": {
    "id": "req_1234567890",
    "idempotency_key": "idem_1234567890"
  }
}
```

### Signature Verification

Webhooks are signed using HMAC-SHA256. The signature is provided in the `Stripe-Signature` header:

```
t=1640995200,v1=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd
```

Where:
- `t` is the timestamp
- `v1` is the signature

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Flask/FastAPI Endpoint**: Create a webhook endpoint that can receive POST requests.

2. **Signature Verification**: Implement HMAC-SHA256 signature verification.

3. **Event Router**: Route different event types to appropriate handlers.

4. **Database Storage**: Store webhook events in a database for audit trail.

5. **Error Handling**: Handle various error scenarios gracefully.

6. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for debugging.

### Example Usage

```python
# Webhook endpoint
@app.route('/webhooks/stripe', methods=['POST'])
def handle_stripe_webhook():
    payload = request.get_data()
    sig_header = request.headers.get('Stripe-Signature')
    
    try:
        event = webhook_handler.verify_and_parse(payload, sig_header)
        webhook_handler.process_event(event)
        return jsonify({'status': 'success'}), 200
    except webhook_handler.InvalidSignatureError:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid signature'}), 400
    except webhook_handler.ProcessingError as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500
```

### Extensions

1. **Multiple Providers**: Support webhooks from multiple payment providers.

2. **Event Filtering**: Filter events based on business rules.

3. **Async Processing**: Process events asynchronously using queues.

4. **Dead Letter Queue**: Handle permanently failed events.

5. **Webhook Testing**: Create tools for testing webhook endpoints.

6. **Event Replay**: Implement ability to replay events for debugging.

### Security Considerations

- Always verify webhook signatures
- Use HTTPS for webhook endpoints
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate event timestamps
- Handle replay attacks
- Log security events

### Evaluation Criteria

- Signature verification implementation
- Event processing logic
- Error handling completeness
- Database design and queries
- Code organization and structure
- Security best practices
- Testing coverage
