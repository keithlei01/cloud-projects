- **Real-world relevance**: Common in payment system integrations

## 📁 Directory Structure

Each question follows the same structure:
```
question-name/
├── README.md          # Problem statement and requirements
├── solution.ts        # Complete working solution
├── my-solution.ts     # Template for candidate implementation
└── test.js           # Jest test suite
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Interviewers
1. Present the problem statement from `README.md`
2. Have the candidate implement in `my-solution.ts`
3. Run tests to verify implementation: `npm run test:question-name`

### For Candidates
