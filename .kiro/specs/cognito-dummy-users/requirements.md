# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an AWS CDK TypeScript application that provisions 3 dummy users in an Amazon Cognito User Pool. The solution will use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to create a reproducible setup for development and testing environments where pre-populated user accounts are needed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to provision a Cognito User Pool with 3 dummy users using AWS CDK, so that I can have consistent test users available for development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a Cognito User Pool
2. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL create exactly 3 dummy users in the User Pool
3. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN each user SHALL have a unique username and email address
4. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN each user SHALL have a temporary password that can be changed on first login

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dummy users to have realistic attributes, so that I can test various user scenarios in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users are created THEN each user SHALL have a valid email format
2. WHEN users are created THEN each user SHALL have a first name and last name attribute
3. WHEN users are created THEN the system SHALL set the user status to allow login
4. IF a user attribute is required by the User Pool THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate default values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CDK code to be well-structured and maintainable, so that I can easily modify or extend the user creation logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CDK code is written THEN it SHALL use TypeScript with proper type definitions
2. WHEN the CDK code is written THEN it SHALL follow AWS CDK best practices for resource organization
3. WHEN the CDK code is written THEN it SHALL include proper error handling for user creation
4. WHEN the CDK code is written THEN it SHALL be modular and allow for easy configuration changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to deploy and destroy the infrastructure easily, so that I can manage development environments efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run cdk deploy THEN the system SHALL successfully create all resources
2. WHEN I run cdk destroy THEN the system SHALL cleanly remove all created resources
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN the stack is deployed THEN it SHALL output relevant information like User Pool ID and user details
