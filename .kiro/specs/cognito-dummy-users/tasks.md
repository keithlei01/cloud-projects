# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up CDK project structure and configuration
  - Create project directory `cognito-dummy-users` in workspace root
  - Initialize package.json with CDK dependencies (@aws-cdk/aws-cognito, @aws-cdk/aws-lambda, @aws-cdk/custom-resources)
  - Create tsconfig.json with TypeScript configuration for CDK
  - Create cdk.json with CDK app configuration and context
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Create CDK application entry point
  - Implement bin/cognito-dummy-users.ts with CDK app initialization
  - Configure stack instantiation with proper naming and environment settings
  - Set up proper CDK app structure following best practices
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.2, 4.1_

- [x] 3. Define user data models and configuration
  - Create TypeScript interfaces for dummy user data structure (DummyUser interface)
  - Define predefined user data array with 3 specific users (keithlei, davidlei, heatherlei)
  - Include email validation and user attribute validation functions
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 4. Implement core Cognito User Pool infrastructure
  - Create lib/cognito-dummy-users-stack.ts with CDK stack structure
  - Implement Cognito User Pool with password policy and required attributes (email, given_name, family_name)
  - Create User Pool Client for application access with proper configuration
  - Add stack outputs for User Pool ID, Client ID, and User Pool ARN
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Implement Lambda function for user creation
  - Create Lambda function code for custom resource user creation using AWS SDK
  - Implement user creation logic with proper Cognito API calls (AdminCreateUser)
  - Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic for user operations
  - Implement cleanup logic for stack deletion (remove users when stack is destroyed)
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.2, 3.3, 4.2_

- [x] 6. Integrate custom resource for user management
  - Create custom resource in CDK stack to trigger user creation Lambda
  - Configure IAM permissions for Lambda to access Cognito User Pool operations
  - Wire Lambda function to custom resource with proper CloudFormation event handling
  - Ensure proper dependency management between User Pool and user creation
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 7. Add deployment configuration and scripts
  - Add npm scripts for CDK commands (deploy, destroy, diff, synth)
  - Create proper CDK bootstrap configuration if needed
  - Add environment-specific configuration options
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive documentation
  - Create README.md with setup, deployment, and usage instructions
  - Document the 3 dummy users and their credentials
  - Add troubleshooting guide for common deployment issues
  - Include examples of how to use the created User Pool
  - _Requirements: 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement unit tests for stack components
  - Write unit tests for CDK stack synthesis and resource validation
  - Test user data generation and validation logic
  - Create tests for Lambda function user creation logic
  - Validate stack outputs and resource properties
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.1_

- [ ] 10. Add integration testing and validation
  - Create integration test script to deploy stack and validate functionality
  - Implement tests to verify user creation in Cognito User Pool
  - Test user authentication capabilities with temporary passwords
  - Add cleanup verification tests for proper stack destruction
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_
